/* If you pass null as the first argument to connect(), it will not subscribe to the Redux store at all. So, if all you want to do is inject some bound action creators you can do that using connect() with a minimal performance impact. This approach can be an excellent way to avoid passing an action creator down to a deeply nested child component. You can connect it directly instead and not lose too much sleep over it. */
